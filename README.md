# Modelling-Bank-Churn-data

This Notebook explores and models the Bank Churn dataset. The work follows an approach offered a "Towards AI" author but extends it to improve predictions. There is EDA, data pre-processing, building and training a Neural Net and ensemble algorithms, and model evaluation.
